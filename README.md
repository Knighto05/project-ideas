# project-ideas

A detailed list of all project ideas we can develop

## How does it work

- Create a folder for each project idea.
- You can create a file main.md inside the folder to describe the project
- Add another subfolders for the details. eg: "core" for core functionnalities, "modules" for other possibilities
- Inside the subfolders, create one file for each functionnality and write down the details of the functionnality. eg: chat.md, stock.md
- Add another hierarchical subfolders when needed
